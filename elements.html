									<h1>About Me</h1>
									
								</header>
									<h2>This is Me.<i><sup>Professionally</sup></i></h2>
									<p>A self-motivated, self-directed individual in search of opportunities to grow professionally as a Data Analyst. 
										I am a graduate of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. I have gone above and beyond what's required 
										of the course by taking up more advanced courses in R, Python, Advanced Excel, Tableau, Power BI & Data Studio.</p>

									<p>In the next steps of my data analytics journey, I am now working as a freelance Sales & Inventory Analyst to 
										further improve my skills in the industry. I've positioned myself well with a firm foundation in data 
										analytics and I'm ready for junior-level opportunities where I hope to be exposed to a project bigger 
										than myself with even bigger learning opportunities. Most importantly, as a self-directed learner that 
										has gone from zero to hero, I have the grit and tenacity to succeed as a Data Analyst. I hope these are 
										the qualities that align with what you are looking for, and hope to hear from you soon!</p>
									<header>
										<h2>Accomplishments in Data Analytics</h2>
										<p>the start of something beautiful...</p>
									</header>	
									<p> <b>Coursera Community Mentor (Data Analytics</b>): I was selected by the Coursera Community Manager as a 
										Community Mentor, due to my course performance but also my willingness to assist fellow learners 
										through the self-learning experience</p>
	
									<p> <b>Portfolio Project Feature</b>: My Bellabeat & Fitbit Capstone Project was featured by Kaggle Grandmaster
									Martin Henze's weekly post 'Hidden Gems in Data Science & Machine Learning.' My project has since received
									4.7kviews and often referred by new learners as starting reference for their own projects.</p>
								
									<h2>This is Me.<i><sup>Personally</sup></i></h2>
									<p>Almost three decades in this world of ours and he decides to pivot into data analytics all of a sudden. Why now?
										What could Zul possibly be thinking? Well, here's the thing fellow reader. I'm not one to go down the well trodden
										path, and perhaps it will the like for the foreseeable future. One could say I've relished the detours I've taken,
										so much so I just see them as the path meant to be.
									</p>

									<p>Here's what I've been up to, at age 18 and right before enlisting, I decided to go on a 3-month backpacking trip 
										around South-East Asia to have a taste of what our rich and vibrant region has to offer. Then it was 2 years in
										the army, where I learnt that I relished in the hot, stressful, messy days out in the field whether it's on the rolling hills
										of Kanchanaburi Thailand, or down in the muddy pits of deep in the forests of good ol' Singapore. Did well enough to 
										finish service as a Platoon Sergeant. 
									</p>
									<p>Then it's a gap year trying to dig deep and understand what's next for me. Not before another trip, this time South of Singapore
										to good ol' Indonesia as I planned to go from the the Western most tip of Indonesia, Aceh to the other end of the island in Bakau. 
										Decided on a whim to take up scuba diving and I was spoilt silly by the pristine waters of Pulau Weh. Stayed a little longer
										and ended up completing my Open Water Diver course because I wanted to, then completed the Advanced Open Water Diver course because
										I fell in love with it all.
									</p>
									<p>Onwards! WIP
